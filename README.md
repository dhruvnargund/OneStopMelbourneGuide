The Android Smart Tour Guide for Melbourne City!

  This is my final assesment project for SIT708 Mobile Systems Development. The project wascompleted in a duration of 10 weeks while learning Android programming.
  I used java as the programming language of choice, android studio as the IDE and Firebase for providing me a database for the login system.
